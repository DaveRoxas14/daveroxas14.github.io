# About

Hi there! My name is Dave Roxas and I'm a Senior Game Developer from the beautiful country of the Philippines. With over 8 years of experience, I have a strong passion for creating immersive and engaging video games. My expertise lies in tools and engine development, with a strong focus on utilizing C# to bring my ideas to life.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of small indie games. This has allowed me to develop a diverse skill set and adapt to different development environments, making me a versatile and valuable asset to any team.

What I love most about being a game developer is the ability to combine my technical skills with my creativity to create unique and memorable gaming experiences. I'm always up for a challenge and enjoy pushing the boundaries of what is possible in game development.

Aside from my technical skills, I am also a strong team player and thrive in collaborative environments. I believe that great games are created by great teams, and I always strive to bring out the best in my fellow developers.
